BitShares
--------
1. **What is BitShares?** BitShares is a family of Distributed Autonomous Corporations that are derived from PTS and AGS.
2. **How can I get involved?** The best way is to sign up on the [forum](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php) and get involved in the discussions there.
3. **I have mad coding skills, who can I talk to about a job?** Bounties for small marketing and development tasks are regularly posted [on the forum](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?board=38.0), or you can send an email to [contact.us@invictus-innovations.com](contact.us@invictus-innovations.com).
4. **How is BitShares different from Bitcoin?** Bitcoin is a single crypto-equity that serves only one purpose: to process and secure monetary transactions. Owners of Bitcoins earn no income. BitShares is a family of crypto-equities that all adhere to the DAC concept, explained below. In particular, shareholders in a BitShares DAC earn income from the DAC's activities.

General Crypto-Equity Questions
-------------------------------
1. **What is a Crypto-Equity?** A crypto-equity is a software program that runs on many different computers simultaneously around the world. Bitcoin was the first crypto-equity; today, there are hundreds. Crypto-equities typically are composed of tokens (such as bitcoins) that can be traded from person to person; these trades are recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain.
2. **What is a blockchain?** A blockchain is a public ledger that records who owns how many tokens of a crypto-equity; it is the basic building block of any crypto-equity. Blockchains are created and updated in a decentralized way; the crypto-equity's protocol is designed in a way that thousands of independent computers can all come to a consensus on what data should be in the blockchain.
3. **Are Crypto-Equities secure?** Yes, extremely. For example, if a thief knew your bitcoin public address, it would take them billions of years with a supercomputer to compute your private key (that is, steal the bitcoins you held in that address).
4. **But I heard that the Bitcoin exchange MtGox was hacked. Isn't that a bad sign?** Attackers exploited a security flaw at MtGox and stole thousands of bitcoins - but the Bitcoin protocol itself was never compromised. This is analogous to someone robbing an armored truck and running off with unmarked bills; compromising a single truck does not compromise the very concept of money.


DAC
---
1. **What is a DAC?** DAC stands for Distributed Autonomous Company. It is a software entity that, like a traditional company, earns money for its shareholders. Unlike a traditional company, it operates autonomously on a blockchain; it requires no board of directors or CEO to accomplish its goals.
2. **Why "Decentralized?"** Decentralization is necessary to ensure that no malicious individual or group can control the DAC. Since the DAC operates simultaneously on thousands of computers across the world, an attacker would have to gain control of all the computers to gain control of the DAC.
3. **Why "Autonomous?"** Autonomy is necessary to ensure that despite having no board of directors, the DAC functions properly on its own. Bitcoin is autonomous in this way: the Bitcoin Foundation could disappear tomorrow, but Bitcoin software would go on validating transactions as if nothing had changed.
4. **Why "Company?"** A DAC earns money for its shareholders. This is the key factor that sets DACs apart from 1st-generation crypto-equities like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Decentralized and Autonomous, but since it does not generate income for its shareholders, it is not a DAC. 
5. **How is a DAC different from a traditional company?** A traditional company is run by people; if you employ the company's services you must trust that the people who run the company will do what they say. A DAC requires no trust in people.
6. **What can be done with a DAC?** This is the 100-billion-dollar question! The whole project of BitShares is to find the answer. At the moment, it is theorized that music distribution, publishing, gambling, DNS, voting, personal identity verification, and even insurance can all be accomplished with DACs.

Future BitShares DACs
--------------

1. **What future DACs are being planned?** There are plan for BitShares Bingo, BitShares Voice (a voting platform), BitShares Music, and BitShares DNS, to name a few.
2. **How can I get a stake in future DACs?** You can buy PTS or donate to AGS.
3. **I have a great idea for a DAC. Who do I talk to?** The BitShares forum has an excellent [sounding board](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?board=9.0) for alternative DAC ideas. If you want to develop your DAC publicly, go to the forum and start a discussion!

BitShares PTS (Formerly known as ProtoShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares PTS?** BitShares PTS is a simple minable crypto-equity (similar to Bitcoin) that was created to allow people to buy a stake in future DACs. The idea is that when a DAC is launched, at least 10% of the DAC's total shares are given proportionally to holders of PTS. Daniel Larimer once described buying PTS as "buying shares in the concept of DACs."
2. **Why isn’t it called ProtoShares anymore?** BitShares PTS was previously referred to as "Protoshares." However, "ProtoShare" is a registered trademark of Site9, Inc. for its prototyping and mock-up software product, ProtoShare. There is no relationship between ProtoShare and BitShares PTS. 
3. **What is a snapshot?** Before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is analogous to a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns PTS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
4. **Why must I withdraw my PTS to a wallet?** As with any crypto-equty, there is risk in storing your PTS on an exchange, so it's best practice not to do this. In addition, you don't actually control the private keys when your PTS sit on an exchange, and the exchange might not go through the trouble of redeeming "your" shares.
5. **Do I lose my PTS after a snapshot?** No, PTS are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your PTS when you get new shares in a DAC.
6. **Why did the price of PTS fall so much right after February 28, 2014?** February 28, 2014 was the date of the official snapshot for the BitShares XT project. Thus, people who owned PTS on February 28 now have a stake reserved in BitShares XT; the PTS price drop reflects the fact that on March 1, PTS no longer contained the value of BitShares XT.
7. **Why should I get PTS rather than AGS?** The main advantage of PTS is that it is liquid. Since it's just a simple crypto-equity, you can sell your PTS on an exchange (like Cryptsy, Poloniex, BTC38, or many others) whenever you wish.
8. **How can I get PTS?** You can purchase PTS on any Bitcoin exchange. For more information, click [here](http://invictus.io/bitshares-pts.php).
9. **What is the Social Consensus?** The Social Consensus is a concept pioneered by Daniel Larimer that states that developers of new DACs honor PTS (and AGS); i.e., that at least 10% of the total shares in any new DAC be apportioned to holders of PTS.
10. **Why would a DAC developer honor PTS (and AGS)?** By giving part of their new DAC to holders of PTS (and AGS), the developer immediately puts their DAC in the hands of a large dynamic motivated community that believes in the concepts of DACs.

BitShares AGS (Formerly known as AngelShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares AGS?** BitShares AGS is similar to PTS in that AGS holders are granted stakes in new DACs proportionally to their holdings. The difference is that AGS holders have paid into a development fund rather than simply bought a crypto-equity. Thus, AGS is not liquid.
2. **Why isn’t it called AngelShares anymore?** Similar to PTS, the "AngelShares" name ran into trademark issues, so it has been dropped in favor of the simpler moniker "BitShares AGS."
3. **What is a snapshot?** Similar to PTS, before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is like a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns AGS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
4. **Do I lose my AGS after a snapshot?** No, AGS (like PTS) are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your AGS when you get new shares in a DAC.
5. **Why should I buy AGS rather than PTS?** The main advantage of AGS is that its market price reflects the fact that it is not liquid. That is, you typically get more "bang for your buck" with AGS than you do with PTS because you can't simply sell your AGS whenever you want.
6. **What happens to my Bitcoin or PTS when I donate?** All donated funds are placed in a public account that is used solely to advance the development of DACs.
7. **How can I get AGS?** If you have Bitcoin or PTS that you would like to donate, go [here](http://invictus.io/bitshares-ags.php) and follow the instructions.
8. **Is it better to donate Bitcoin, or to donate PTS?** On [this website](http://www1.agsexplorer.com/), the Bitcoin column (on the left) and PTS column (on the right) have a field called "Donation Efficiency." If the Donation Efficiency of Bitcoin is 120%, this means that at current donation rates and market prices, you're getting 20% more AGS by donating with Bitcoin than you would by donating the same value of PTS.

XT: The First Decentralized Bank and Exchange
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares XT?** BitShares XT is the first BitShares DAC under development. It operates something like a cross between a traditional bank and a securities exchange. 
2. **What is XTS?** XTS is the name of the base token of BitShares XT. That is, XTS is what PTS and AGS holders will receive, and XTS is the unit that will be traded on the centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (Cryptsy, Poloniex, BTC38, etc.).
3. **What is the difference between BitShares X and XT?**  BitShares X is a family of DACs based on the decentralized exchange concept. Each one will have its own blockchain and will implement different variations on the core idea. The "T" in BitShares XT stands for "Test"; it is the first DAC in the BitShares X family.
4. **How does BitShares XT work?** There are two interlinked components to BitShares XT: BitAssets and the Exchange. A BitAsset is a special type of token that tracks the value of a real-world asset; for example, one BitUSD will be worth one US Dollar. Users of BitShares XT will be able to trade their XTS for BitAssets on the decentralized exchange.
5. **How is BitUSD created?** Any BitShares XT user will be able to take out a loan of BitUSD using their XTS as collateral. Suppose 1 XTS is worth 1 USD: If I have 10 XTS in my BitShares XT wallet, I can borrow up to 1 BitUSD using my XTS as collateral. I am then free to sell this BitUSD on the decentralized exchange, but my collateral XTS are locked and unspendable until I repay the BitUSD loan.
6. **How is BitUSD destroyed?** If I borrow 1 BitUSD when the market price XTS is 1 USD, and then the market price of XTS falls so that I have only 1.5 USD worth of XTS left; in other words, if I am at risk for not being able to repay the BitUSD I borrowed, then BitShares XT will re-possess enough of my XTS to cover the loan and charge me a 5% fee. This is known as a "margin call." The XTS that is confiscated will be used to automatically purchase BitUSD on the exchange, and this BitUSD will be destroyed to repay my loan.
7. **How does BitUSD track the value of real-world USD?** The tracking is accomplished by the power of decentralized free markets. If BitUSD is ever worth more than real-world USD, people will expect its price to fall to the price of real-world USD, so they will borrow BitUSD and immediately sell it on the decentralized exchange, which will push the price down. Then when the price falls, they can buy back their BitUSD cheaper than they sold it and profit.
8. **What fees are charged to users of BitShares XT?** A small percentage fee is assessed for every trade on the exchange, a 5% margin call fee is assessed to every user subject to a margin call, and a 5% inactivity fee is assessed to every address that has had no activity for a full year.
9. **How does BitShares XT earn income for owners of XTS?** All fees are payed to holders of XTS. This is what makes BitShares XT a DAC: the fact that it produces income for its owners.
10. **How does BitShares XT interface with the traditional money system?** XTS, the native currency unit of BitShares XT, will likely be traded on exchanges like [Cryptsy](http://www.cryptsy.com) and [Bter](http://www.bter.com).
11. **Which BitAssets will be available in BitShares XT?** The list has not yet been finalized, but at the very least, there will be three: BitUSD, BitBTC (to track Bitcoin), and BitGLD (to track the price of gold).
12. **Will XTS be minable?** No, the BitShares XT network will be secured by Transactions-as-Proof-of-Stake (TaPOS), a novel method that requires no mining. For more information, see the [TaPOS whitepaper](http://invictus.io/assets/pdf/TransactionsAsProofOfStake10.pdf).
13. **I still don't understand BitShares XT. Where can I find more information?** You should read the most recent version of the [BitShares XT whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLcjSXWuU9vBJzzqLEXVACSCdn8zXKTTJRN_LfoCjNY/edit?disco=AAAAAH7fcks). If you still have questions, [the forum](http://bitsharestalk.org) has many threads with excellent discussions, or you can simply ask a question there.


Redeeming PTS and AGS for XTS (BitShares XT)
----------------------------------------------
1. **What happened on February 28, 2014?** This was the snapshot date for BitShares XT. PTS and AGS holders on this date will be given a stake in BitShares XT: for each PTS or AGS held, the holder will be awarded 1.33 XTS.
2. **I owned PTS (or AGS) on February 28, 2014. How can I get my XTS?** BitShares XT has not launched yet. Don't worry, your PTS ownership was recorded and you'll be able to claim your XTS when BitShares XT is launched soon. You can view your future XTS balance [here](http://bitbalance.azurewebsites.net/).
3. **I did not own PTS (or AGS) on February 28. How can I get XTS?** Since the snapshot date is passed, you will have to wait until BitShares XT is launched and XTS is listed on an exchange, where you will be able to buy it like any other crypto-equity.
4. **How can I get a stake in future BitShares X Products?** Future BitShares X DACs will use snapshots of XT for their initial allocations, just like BitShares XT used a PTS/AGS snapshot for its initial allocation.
5. **When will BitShares XT launch?** At the earliest, BitShares XT will launch on the Ides of March (March 15, 2014).
